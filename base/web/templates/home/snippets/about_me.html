            <p class="mt-6 text-pretty text-lg/8 text-gray-300">
              During my two years in a work-study program at a start-up specializing in web and mobile development, I gained valuable experience working on various projects, from initial design to deployment, not forgetting continuous maintenance. This immersion allowed me to understand the challenges at each stage of the development process and to collaborate closely with different teams. I was able to strengthen my technical skills while refining my project management abilities. In particular, I developed solid expertise in Django, whether for creating dynamic websites or implementing robust APIs. Web design is one of my strengths, and I take real pleasure in combining aesthetics and performance to offer exceptional user experiences.
